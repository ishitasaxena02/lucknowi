		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a computer science engineer belonging to the city of Lucknow. I am basically pursuing Front-End Development. This page is my creation which I have proudly made from scratch. Starting from the blank screen to achieving this complete page is an example that I am a trustworthy Web-Developer.</p><p>Coming to my background, I have always been a keen learner who wanted to give a shot in this web development. My first project is on my city because it holds a very special place in my heart. It is my birth place.</p><p>Currently, I am in Prayagraj because of my college. Politically as well as historically Prayagraj is also a very important place. Now, as my birth-place and my work-place are both significant historcally so I got this Idea of creating this site on a particular place.</p><p>I hope you guys like it.</p>
